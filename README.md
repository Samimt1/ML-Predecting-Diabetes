The purpose of predicting diabetes risk using machine learning is to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes by analyzing health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, and age. Machine learning models can detect patterns and correlations in large datasets that may not be apparent through traditional methods, enabling early diagnosis and intervention. This approach helps prevent severe complications like heart disease and kidney failure by promoting timely lifestyle changes and medical care. Additionally, it reduces healthcare costs by focusing resources on at-risk individuals and improving overall public health outcomes. Ultimately, predicting diabetes risk with machine learning aims to enhance quality of life through proactive and personalized healthcare solutions.
